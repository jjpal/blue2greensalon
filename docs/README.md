# Next Steps

1. Establish the preliminary draft user requirements

2. Requirements Refinement

        ◦ Conduct stakeholder interviews to validate/expand/narrow initial requirements.

        ◦ Create detailed use cases for each major functionality.

        ◦ Prioritize requirements based on business value and technical feasibility.

3. Process Flow / Diagrams - Data | System Context
       
        ◦ Design high-level diagram showing how the new system will interact with external systems and users.
        
        ◦ Flowcharts/activity diagrams/mapping to illustrate key business processes system will support.

4. Data Dictionary

        ◦ Compile a list of all data elements, definitions, data types, and sources.

        ◦ Review, validate, monitor adoption, and gather feedback

5. Data Source Analysis | Data Collection

        ◦ Identify and analyze all data sources that will feed into the new system.

        ◦ Document data quality issues and necessary transformations.

6. Data Preparation | Data Modeling

        ◦ Gather data, assess / understand the data, and validate data 

        ◦ Process, transform, enrich (note sources if external data), design structure and relationships of data

7. Analytics | Insights & Actions

        ◦ Apply analytical techniques (descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive) to the prepared data.
        ◦ Use data visualization and analytics tools to surface insights and trends.
        ◦ Develop recommendations for business improvements and implement changes.
        ◦ Interpret analytical results and present them in a digestible manner for stakeholders.
        ◦ Identify areas for improvement and opportunities for growth.

#### Future Planning
◦ Data Governance Plan - Outline data ownership, access controls, and data quality management processes.

◦ Risk Assessment - Identify/document potential risks and mitigation strategies. 

◦ Monitor, optimize, and scale
