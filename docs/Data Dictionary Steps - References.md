## Steps To Consider When Creating A Data Dictionary:

    1. Identify data sources and data elements
       ◦ Catalog all relevant data sources and list the data elements (tables, columns, attributes) for each source. 

    2. Define data element attributes
        ◦ For each data element, document attributes:
            ▪ Name
            ▪ Description
            ▪ Format
            ▪ Data type
            ▪ Other attributes to consider: Units, Source (system/origin), Owner, 
              Usage, Constraints, Relationships to other data elements 

    3. Establish a standardized format and taxonomy
        ◦ Develop consistent naming conventions, formats, and taxonomies for data elements and attributes.

    4. Populate the data dictionary
        ◦ Input all the collected metadata and attributes into the chosen platform.

    5. Review and validate
        ◦ Have the team review the data dictionary for accuracy and completeness.

    6. Establish a maintenance process
        ◦ Create procedures for regularly updating and maintaining the data dictionary over time.

    7. Promote usage, monitor adoption and gather feedback
        ◦ Make it accessible, and provide training on how to use it effectively.
        ◦ Track usage and collect input to continually improve the data dictionary.
