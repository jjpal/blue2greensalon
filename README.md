Problem Statement:

The beauty salon finds it challenging to use the information to improve customer experience, streamline their business, and make it more eco-friendly. 

Background (storyline):

The salon has been undergoing a digital transformation to move the business and all its processes to an online platform. The family business is transitioning to a new era, perhaps with a hint of reluctance but great anticipation for the limitless opportunities ahead. In unexpected events, they have a contingency plan to keep the business running smoothly the "old" way, even if there's a power outage or any other unforeseen circumstances. The plan is to start with one location and then move ahead and add the other salon locations.

The salon is missing out on many great opportunities. It is essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of the operations. To make this happen - the data must be gathered from the various parts of the business. The first few things that come to mind that need to be collected include:
- bookings
- service listing
- product listing
- receipt transactions

Other things to consider:
- tracking cancellations and no-shows
- personnel -- schedule with frequent customers
- reviews

To integrate eco-friendly practices into the salon's operations, the salon is considering implementing the following strategies:

- Use green cleaning products: Replace conventional cleaning supplies with non-toxic, biodegradable options that use plant-based ingredients like citrus, aloe vera, and essential oils.

- Implement energy-efficient practices:

  - Install LED light bulbs throughout the salon, including track lighting, reception lamps, and bathroom vanities.

  - Add occupancy sensors and timers to further reduce energy consumption.

  - Invest in energy-saving equipment and appliances.

- Conserve water:

  - Install low-flow plumbing fixtures, including faucets, showerheads, and toilets.
 
  - Use ECOHEADS shower nozzles at shampoo bowls to reduce water usage while maintaining pressure.

- Implement waste reduction and recycling:

  - Set up clearly labeled recycling bins throughout the salon for paper, plastic, glass, and metal.

  - Rinse and recycle bulk product containers.

  - Adopt biodegradable alternatives for shipping materials and retail bags.

- Choose eco-friendly salon products:

  - Use organic, vegan, and cruelty-free professional beauty products.

  - Opt for products free from harsh ingredients like sulfates, parabens, phthalates, and artificial fragrances.

- Educate staff and clients:

  - Provide training for your team on eco-friendly practices and the salon's environmental goals.

  - Post signage about green initiatives and share eco-efforts on social media to raise awareness.

  - Ideate new ways to encourage clients to adopt eco-friendly habits

- Conduct regular environmental audits:

  - Assess current practices and identify areas for improvement in energy use, product choices, and waste management.
