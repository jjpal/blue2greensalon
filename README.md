Problem Statement:

The beauty salon finds it challenging to use the information to improve customer experience, streamline their business, and make it more eco-friendly. The salon is missing out on many great opportunities. 

Background (storyline):

The salon has been undergoing a digital transformation to move the business and all its processes to an online platform. The family business is transitioning to a new era, perhaps with a hint of reluctance but great anticipation for the limitless opportunities ahead. In unexpected events, they have a contingency plan to keep the business running smoothly the "old" way, even if there's a power outage or any other unforeseen circumstances. The plan is to start with one location and then move ahead and add the other salon locations.

It is essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of the operations. To make this happen - the data must be gathered from the various parts of the business. The first few things that come to mind that need to be collected include:
- bookings
- service listing
- product listing
- receipt transactions
